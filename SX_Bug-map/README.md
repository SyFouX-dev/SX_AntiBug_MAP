# Info
A nice little script I wrote that I find helps those with lower end spec computers. Sometimes I find players fall through the map for a while so I created a script that allows the players to be teleported back to the ground OR back to a predefined location, per config.

# Requirements
None, it’s standalone!

# Features:
Configuration file

# Configuration File:
_displayText_: The message which will be displayed to users\
_key_: Key which activates the teleport. Control key numbers can be found here.\
_preset_: Whether or not to teleport the player to the ground or to a predefined location\
_coords_: The X,Y,Z of the predefined location to teleport the player to if *preset* is true\
_z_check_: The Z coordinate to display the prompt and allow the player to teleport\
_freeze_: Whether or not to freeze the player after the teleport\
_freeze_time_: The amount of time to freeze the player for -in seconds- if *freeze* is set to true
